# Contributing :purple_heart:

Thanks for thinking about helping with [market_client][]!
Here are a couple of ways that you can contribute:

- [Report issues](issues).
- Fix issues (especially ones with the label
  **[help wanted](https://github.com/SlayerOrnstein/market_client/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22%20)**).
  - If this is your first contribution—_welcome!_—please
    check out issues that are
    labeled **[beginner](https://github.com/SlayerOrnstein/market_client/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22%20label%3Abeginner%20)**.
  - We use the usual [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process.

To avoid wasting your time, please talk with us before you make any nontrivial
pull request. The [issue tracker](issues)
is a good way to track your progress publicly, but we can also communicate
other ways such as email and [Discord](https://discord.gg/jGZxH9f).

### Run tests

Github action runs these too, but your PR will look better if all tests pass the
first time:

```
dart run test
```
